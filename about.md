title: About Me.

Automation, config management and orchestration addict. I design and build large scale IP networks, play with cool technology and kick ass at table tennis.

Currently building the next generation in Colocation, Connectivity and Cloud at [DataCentred](http://datacentred.co.uk), operators of one of the UK's biggest public OpenStack installations.

You can talk to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bilco105), critique my code on [Github](https://github.com/bilco105), grab my GPG from [Keybase](https://keybase.io/bilco105) or stalk me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/bilco105).
